    <p> Technological advances are changing the world in ways
that could not have been imagined. The emergence of
advanced digital innovations are providing new opportunities
to connect and learn, and have begun influencing every aspect
of human life.
Children and young people have shown greater ability to adapt
and adopt digital devices and innovations, which augurs well
for the future. They use the devices and apps for a variety of
functions, including self-expression, communication,
networking, research, entertainment, and much more. The
internet has enabled children to become active social agents
and to mobilise for social, ecological and other causes. They
are increasingly able to project their voices with
unprecedented reach.
However, an assumption is often made that young people
have superior skills with digital technology, which surpass
those of their parents and teachers.
It may or may not be right. Many young people are confident
in using a wide range of technologies and often turn to the
internet for information. They seem able to learn to operate
unfamiliar hardware or software very quickly and may take on
the role of teaching adults how to use computers and the
internet. But the confidence with digital technology can also
be misleading.
Many of them frequently struggle when applying them to
research tasks. They can find it difficult to work out whether
information on an unfamiliar website is trustworthy, and rely
on their chosen search engine’s rankings for their selection of
material. They may not understand how search terms work or
of the powerful commercial forces that can result in a
particular company being top of the search engine’s list. They
may not be aware of the lurking risks and threats and the fact
that some of their actions can invite them trouble.
Furthermore, the digital skills and knowledge are not evenly
spread amongst all young people. Dearth of research on the
subject has prevented a nuanced analysis of who are most
likely to lag behind in the opportunities afforded by
technological advances. However, there is general agreement
among those working on cyber safety and security among
children and young people that gender is a major impediment.
Social norms have impeded girls’ access to opportunities,
including the access and use of digital devices and the
internet. Many of them belonging to socially or economically
marginalised families in rural, semi-urban and urban areas
have either no access, or limited, or supervised access to
digital technologies, which could enable them to exercise their
agency, autonomy and rights in an increasingly
interconnected world.
The exploration of new vistas and acquisition of rich
experiences online require a strong element of caution. After
all, every light has its shadow. The technologies can be
misused or overused in ways that are detrimental to the users
and even non-users.
UNICEF in its Child Online Protection in India report in 2016
had presented the following typology of risks and threats.</p><br><br>

    <p><br><br><br><br><h3>Tools such as anti-virus software, biometrics and personal
devices, e.g., the secure chip in a credit card or an ePassport
are digital security devices because they offer freedom to
communicate, work, travel and shop using your digital
identity in a way that is secure.
Digital security is an all-encompassing term, which includes
the tools to secure technology, assets and personal identity in
the online and mobile world.</h3>

    <p>Viruses on digital devices are malicious programme codes that can corrupt the system and destroy the data within the computer</p>
    <ul>
      <br><br><li><b><h2>Malware</h2></b></li>
      <p>Malware is a type of malicious software designed to gain
unauthorized access or to cause damage to a computer
without the knowledge of the owner, stealing and even
deleting sensitive data, altering or hijacking computer
functions to monitor users’ computer activity</p>
      <br><br><li><b><h2>Ransomware</h2></b></li>
      <p>Ransomware is a type of malicious software designed to
extort money from the user. The attacker locks the victim’s
computer system files or blocks access to files or the
computer system typically through encryption until the
ransom is paid. Paying the ransom is no guarantee that the
files will be recovered or the system will be restored. </p>
      <br><br><li><b><h2>Your One-Up about Hackers</h2></b></li>
      <p>A hacker is someone who will gain entry into a computer
without permission, with the intention to use or <br> exploit
technology to cause harm, steal or destroy the data
contained in it. </p>
    </ul>
    <br><br><p>Usually hackers are well versed with computer technologies
by using various applications or programmes that penetrate
the defence mechanism employed by the target computer
and send back the sensitive information like usernames,
passwords, IP addresses and using them to gain access into
the computer itself.
These applications or programmes can be in the form of
Trojans, worms, malware and viruses, which will install in the
system and compromise its security. After all, if the hacker
can gain administrative rights, they’re free to do anything
with the data contained in the compromised computer
system. Several public locations like shopping malls and airports
among others offer their customers free access to public
Wi-Fi. But public Wi-Fi networks also enable cyber criminals
to spy on unwary customers, take advantage of this
convenience and intercept their data. They can access
sensitive information of users’ banking credentials, account
passwords and other valuable information. </p>

   <br> <p><br><h2>Install anti-virus software and ensure that is updated as
regularly as possible. Some computers have built-in
anti-virus software too. </h2><br>
</p>
<ol>
      <br><br><li><b><h2>Regularly update software and operating systems</h2></b></li>
      <br><p>Web browsers, plugins (Java and Adobe Products) and even
Office Suites. It is the most common way hackers and
malware try to gain access to devices and your information</p>

      <br><br><li><b><h2>Use privacy settings on mobile phones, apps and browsers</h2></b></li>
     <br> <p>Privacy settings on social media platforms enable you to
select who can access your posts online. Try to restrict
access of your profile to your friends only. Remember <b> what
you post online remains there almost forever.</b></p>

      <br><br><li><b><h2>Verify if the Wi-Fi link is legitimate and safe</h2></b></li>
     <br> <p>Treat all Wi-Fi links with suspicion. Public Wi-Fi is inherently
insecure — so be cautious. The Wi-Fi link could also be a
bogus link set up by a cybercriminal trying to capture
valuable, personal information from unsuspecting users.
Don’t connect to an unknown or unrecognised wireless
access point. Try to use known Wi-Fi links, which are
password protected.</p>

<br><br><li><b><h2>Learn to create VPN to avoid downloading of data through
public Wi-Fi</h2></b></li>
     <br> <p>Use your mobile phone to create VPN If you need to access
any websites that store or require the input of any sensitive
information consider accessing them via your mobile phone
network, instead of the public Wi-Fi connection.</p>

<br><br><li><b><h2>Verify if the website is legitimate/authentic</h2></b></li>
     <br> <p>Avoid logging into websites where there’s a chance that your
identity, passwords or personal information may be
compromised — for example, online banking services or any
websites that store your credit card information.
</p>

<br><br><li><b><h2>Keep webcams private</h2></b></li>
      <br><p>These devices can sometimes be hacked and used to take
pictures or videos of you without your consent. Put a sticker
over your webcam, laptop camera, or phone camera when
they are not in use.</p>

<br><br><li><b><h2> Download apps from trusted sources like Google play, AppStore</h2></b></li>
    </ol><br><br><br>

    <ul>
      <br><br><li><b><h2>Passwords</h2></b></li><br>
      <p>Strong, unique but easy to remember, and private passwords
are essential for dealing with unauthorised access to online
accounts. The passwords, when shared with other person(s),
can be misused. They may be stolen by unauthorized users to
collect and misuse your personal information.
Learn how to create strong passwords and passphrases. A
password must be difficult to guess. But you should be able
to remember it. Writing passwords somewhere is not
advisable. Memorise it. Your password is given to you to
maintain your privacy. Go for an extra layer of security by opting for two-factor
authentication (2FA), also known as two-step verification or
dual factor authentication. This security process requires the
user to provide two different authentication factors to verify
themselves to better protect both the user's credentials and
the resources the user can access.
Log out of your account when you plan to be inactive even for
a short while. Always keep your system locked whenever it is
not in use.</p>

      <br><br><li><b><h2>Emails And Messages</h2></b></li><br>
      <p>Most email providers offer filtering services.<br><br>
The use of Rich Text Format instead of the standard .DOC
format will retain the formatting but not any macros. This
may prevent you from sending virus to others if you are
already infected by it.</p>

      <br><br><li><b><h2>Security Settings On The Browser</h2></b></li>
      <p><br><br>• Update anti-virus software regularly.<br><br>
• Adjust the settings in the web-browser. It may limit some
functionality but can provide the best protection from
malicious content.<br><br>
• Enable email accounts for multi-factor authentication. Email
is the gateway to almost every other account a user may
have. When someone loses or forgets an account password,
the reset is sent to his or her email.<br><br>
• Gauge the credibility of the website by checking the URL,
lock.<br><br>
• Look out for warning signals given by web browsers about
exposure to a malicious website or content. Such warnings
can protect the user from malware, phishing and identity
theft. These warnings given by most of the commonly used
browsers like Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc. Remember to
update your browsers regularly to avoid missing out on such
updates.<br><br>
• Exercise caution while giving details about personal
information when registering for access to email accounts,
social networks and chat rooms, and free game downloads.</p>
