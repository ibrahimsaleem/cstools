Python script to change MAC address of Linux machine
What is MAC Address?
In a computer network, the MAC Address is used at the lowest networking level,where network interfaces
communicate with one another.
Need of changing MAC Address:
    To bypass MAC Address filtering
    To bypass certain kind of MITM spoofing attack
    To avoid device tracking in a public network
There are many other tasks like becoming anonymous in a network and to avoid some network attacks 
where changing MAC Address becomes useful.

Changing MAC Address in Linux Machine: In Linux, a simple way to change MAC address is by using 
ifconfig command.

For that we are using 3 python modules here
1st is subprocess 
subprocess is used to execute system commands 
    IT contain a number of functions
    These functions allow us to execute system commands
    commands depend on the OS which execute the script

2nd is optparse
Optparse module makes easy to write command-line tools.
    It allows argument parsing in the python program.
    optparse make it easy to handle the command-line argument.

3rd is re which is regular expresssion
Python has a built-in package called re, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions.
    The re module offers a set of functions that allows us to search a string for a match.
